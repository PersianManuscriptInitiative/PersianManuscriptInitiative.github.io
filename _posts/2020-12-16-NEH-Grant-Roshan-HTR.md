The National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded the [Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park (Roshan Institute-UMD)](http://sllc.umd.edu/persian) a Level III Digital Humanities Advancement Grant in the amount of $324,571 for the "Automatic Collation for Diversifying Corpora: Improving Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script Manuscripts" project. [Matthew Thomas Miller](https://matthewthomasmiller.github.io/)—Assistant Professor of Persian Literature at Roshan Institute-UMD and Director of the [Roshan Initiative in Persian Digital Humanities](https://persdig.umd.edu/)—will serve as the Principal Investigator of this project, with [David Smith](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/david-smith/)—Associate Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University—serving as the co-Principal Investigator.

This project will greatly advance the field of handwritten text recognition (i.e., optical character recognition for manuscripts) by producing a "distantly supervised" system capable of automatically producing large amounts of training data.
